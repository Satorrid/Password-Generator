# Password-generator

The goal of this challenge was to create a random password generator using javascript. In order to make sure the password was secure, it was important that I use uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to generate a secure password. The most difficult part of this challenge was finding a way to randomly select characters from each array.
